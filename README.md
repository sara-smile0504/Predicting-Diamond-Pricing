# Predicting-Diamond-Pricing

Goal of this project was to predict the diamond prices as a function of their size, color, and quality characteristics. 

Booth_Diamonds python file uses stepwise for feature selection and ultimately linear regression for prediction. A comparison was made between the statsmodel and sklearn packages to compare the accurracy of the models. This was done using the diamonds file.

Booth_Diamonds_GeneticAlgorithm compares the statistical method of genetic algorithms for feature selection to the sklearn and statsmodels packages generic feature selection in order to determine accurracy of genetic algorithm models. It was found that Genetic Algorithms is a highly selective method and results in a better performing model than the others.
